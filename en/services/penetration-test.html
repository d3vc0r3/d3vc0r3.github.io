                Penetration Testing (PT) is a security testing service provided by an independent third-party professional information security team to an organization. The team performs security attacks on the organization’s software and hardware, including websites, information systems and other equipment by imitating hacker’s mindset within the organization’s boundary agreed beforehand. The goal of this service is to locate underlying vulnerabilities and validate whether the organization’s data and equipment are secure against theft or destruction. Additionally, the overall architecture of information systems and hardware are also assessed for possible security improvement.

                Hacker attacks are pervasive and infectious, like real-life viruses. The threat is imminent and persistent. Penetration testing, on the other hand, is like a health examination. If the organizations can regularly perform in-depth information security health checks, their security architecture weaknesses could be minimized, and be granted with greater chance of survival facing various attacks in the future.

                  <p>
                    DEVCORE will negotiate with the Consignor and conduct the testing basically during the Consignor's business hours, so that the Consignor is able to dispatch the developers to patch critical vulnerabilities in time. In addition, DEVCORE will also inform the consignor about the specific IP addresses used for testing, in order to distinguish them from other unauthorized sources and mitigate possible attacks at the same time.

                  <p>
                    Vulnerability scan can be done with automated scanner software in a shorter time, which is relatively faster and cheaper. However, vulnerability scan can only detect already known vulnerabilities, rather than discovering latest security issues and providing patch suggestions. Penetration testing relies on experienced information security experts to do it manually. Throughout the testing process, different security loopholes will be combined into attack chains by the experts, and carry out persistent attacks to verify whether there's any method to break the website's defenses available.

                    How much time does it take to conduct a penetration testing?
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    Depending on the scale and complexity of the organization's systems, a single website takes about a month to go through the whole process, from preliminary test, remediation, to advanced test.

                  <p>
                    Compared with automated testing, manual testing offers benefits including higher testing accuracy, greater depth of inspection, capability of distinguishing business logic flaws, etc.

                  <p>
                    Hacker attacks are constantly evolving threats. Even a website kept unaltered without any minor modification can be intruded with new attack vectors in the future. Additionally, most business websites must develop new features. Therefore, we suggest organizations to regularly do penetration testing each year.

                  <p>
                    According to Taiwan Financial Supervisory Commission, banking system websites should perform two penetration testing each year, and regular organization websites or networking services should perform penetration testing at least once annually.

                  <p>
                    Penetration testing involves in accessing an organization's sensitive information and must be legally authorized beforehand. Therefore DEVCORE can only accept testing requests from the website's owner or organization.

                    Are there certain qualifications for vendors performing penetration testing?
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    Currently there are no rules or regulations governing such services and their providers. However, before purchasing a penetration testing service, we suggest you to make sure whether the vendor is capable of providing high quality services. Some checkpoints can be whether the vendor had discovered vulnerabilities in prominent software or networking services, or whether they had presented their information security techniques in major conferences. By knowing these, an organization can avoid recruiting a under-qualified vendor to perform penetration testing by only using automated software.
